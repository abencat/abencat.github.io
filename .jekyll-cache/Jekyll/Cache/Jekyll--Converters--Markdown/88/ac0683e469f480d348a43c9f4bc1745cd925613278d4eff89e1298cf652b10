<p>Why we want to look at this problem? We want to estimate divisional tobin’q instead of just standalone tobin’s Q because it gives what kind of different insights?</p>

<p>This paper develops a new method to estimate the divisional valuation of conglomerates. Assuming that divisions in the same industry by from different conglomerates have the same Q value, the authors use quintile regression to estimate the value of conglomerate divisions. Based on their estimates, the paper found some results different from extant literature. Even though divisional investment is less sensitive to standalone q as shown in the literature, it is more sensitive to divisional q.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261970">Lang and Stulz (1994)</a> forms a portfolio of comparable standalone to mimic the performance of conglomerates.</p>

<p>The contribution of this is its novel methodolog. I am personally very fond of the results. However, I need to give it a call to some concepts and model assumptions. Some econometric techniques can help.</p>

<p>My first concern is about the definition of divisional Q. It is kind of ill-defined</p>

<p>My second concern is about the core assumption that all conglomerates have the same divisional Q value.</p>

<p>The third concern is about the interpretation of the estimate. Following the second concern, the identification comes at the cost to assume all the conglomerates have the same divisional q. It is a better to interpret it as an industry Q.</p>
