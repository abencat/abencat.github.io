<p>Why we want to look at this problem? We want to estimate divisional tobin‚Äôq instead of just standalone tobin‚Äôs Q because it gives what kind of different insights?</p>

<p>This paper develops a new method to estimate the divisional valuation of conglomerates. Assuming that divisions in the same industry by from different conglomerates have the same Q value, the authors use quintile regression to estimate the value of conglomerate divisions. Based on their estimates, the paper found some results different from extant literature. Even though divisional investment is less sensitive to standalone q as shown in the literature, it is more sensitive to divisional q.</p>
