<p>The word “conglomerate” has been ambiguously defined since its appearance. According to Investopedia, a conglomerate is a corporation made up of a number of different, seemingly unrelated businesses. This definition is vivid enough but does not speak of the core distinction of conglomerate and why it is an important topic in corporate finance. Weston (1970) gives a thorough presentation of how to define a conglomerate. He divided the business patterns into eight types. Some of them may operate in different industries but their products are highly correlated and economy of scale plays a crucial role. These companies are called “concentrically”. Conglomerates should meet the following necessary requirement: companies whose diversificcation, either internal or external, involves products whose engineering, design, production and marketing functional capabilities requirements <strong>overlap to a very small degree</strong>, which is called non-concentrically diversified companies. Weston gives two main operational types of conglomerates. The first is called managerial conglomerates. A group of management specialists provide services to all of the operating entities. The second is called financial conglomerates, where the parent supplies primarily financial resources.</p>

<p>Since there is little economy of scale in production, why there exist some conglomerates? This question was of great interests to economists during 1950s and 1960s, until it gave ways to MM theorem and option pricing. This interest is ignited again recently for sort of reasons. It raises interests of financial research for two reasons: first, conglom provides a great lab for studying internal capital market; second, conglomerate merger is a great setting to test managerial incentive. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">Coarse (1937)</a> gives a universal hypothesis which one strand of theories, internal capital market, descends from. The paper itself is to rationalize the existence of firm as an efficient organizational form of production. According to his theory, firms exist because of the inefficiency of pricing mechanism. In some cases, the cost of using pricing mechansim is higher than putting the resources under the control of authorities inside a firm when allocating resources. Similarly, Weston (1970) contends that diversified firms allocate resources more efficiently because they create a larger internal capital market and resource allocation is more efficient in internal than in external capital markets. About the bright side of internal capital markets, Stulz (1990) argues that diversified firms reduce the underinvestment problem described by Myers (1977) by creating a larger internal capital market. However, there are even more literature talking about the dark side of internal capital market. Most of them provide evidence that internal capital market operates quite inefficiently in the sense of overinvestment in divisions with poor investment opportunities (Stultz, 1990; Berger and Ofek, 1994; Lang and Stultz, 1994; Shin and Stultz, 1998). The economics mechanisms mainly include the information asymmetry costs that arise between central managemetn and divisional managers in decentralized firms.</p>

<p>The conclusions from Berger and Ofek (1994), Lang and Stultz (1994), and Shin and Stultz (1998) are highly reliant on one assumption. That is where this paper challenges and makes itself stand out. To make that clear, we have to start from the q-theory of investment, i.e., the neoclassical theory of investment, to explain the empiricial setting. Then we extend it to the case of conglomerates and finally see how this theory directs the literature and creates challenges as well. Let’s first start with interpretation of Tobin’s Q itself. Tobin’s Q is an empirical concept but corresponds to the term “average q” in the theory work. In most empirical settings, Tobin’s Q is defined as the ratio of market value of a firm to the <strong>replacement costs</strong> of its assets. The denominator, the replacement costs of assets, refers to the costs if you just want to build the machines owned by the firm. The numerator refers to the discounted future cash flow. If Q is larger than one, this means that firms are using these machines to produce something worth more than machines. However, if the Q is smaller than one, this means that instead of operating the firm, shareholder would be better off if they shut down the firm and sell the machines. The higher the Tobin’s Q is, the better the firm is. However, what really guides firms’ investment policy is not this “average q”, the elephant in the room is called <strong>marginal Q</strong>. Mathematically, it can be written as $\frac{\partial V}{\partial K}$</p>

<p>Before we really step in what this paper is talking about, we need to have a brief review of three concepts: (1) conglomerates; (2) diversification; (3) Tobin’s Q. We need to bear in mind three questions related to these concepts: (1) why we look at conglomerates? Why conglomerates are special from other non-conglomerates? Are they just huge firms? (2) what is the interpretation of Tobin’s Q? why it is related to investment?</p>

<p>It would be very helpful to catch this paper’s idea if we can understand the following concepts and statements. Those concepts will be super important: (1) Tobin’s Q; (2) Marginal Q; (3) Internal capital market.  And the statements include: (1) Q-theory of investment; (2) The efficiency of internal capital market. It is very luxurious to talk about three concepts in this short presentation. But it is crucial for us to understand how internal capital market comes into such an important position that we want to use conglomerate as a lab to understand it. Then we will see the big picture of this paper.</p>

<p>Why we want to look at this problem? We want to estimate divisional tobin’q instead of just standalone tobin’s Q because it gives what kind of different insights?</p>

<p>This paper develops a new method to estimate the divisional valuation of conglomerates. Assuming that divisions in the same industry by from different conglomerates have the same Q value, the authors use quintile regression to estimate the value of conglomerate divisions. Based on their estimates, the paper found some results different from extant literature. Even though divisional investment is less sensitive to standalone q as shown in the literature, it is more sensitive to divisional q.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261970">Lang and Stulz (1994)</a> forms a portfolio of comparable standalone to mimic the performance of conglomerates.</p>

<p>The contribution of this is its novel methodolog. I am personally very fond of the results. However, I need to give it a call to some concepts and model assumptions. Some econometric techniques can help.</p>

<p>My first concern is about the definition of divisional Q. It is kind of ill-defined</p>

<p>My second concern is about the core assumption that all conglomerates have the same divisional Q value.</p>

<p>The third concern is about the interpretation of the estimate. Following the second concern, the identification comes at the cost to assume all the conglomerates have the same divisional q. It is a better to interpret it as an industry Q.</p>
