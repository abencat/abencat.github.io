Entrepreneurship and information on past failures: a natural experiment

how public information on past entrepreneurial failure affects entrepreneurs’ ability to borrow and start new ventures. 

We exploit a policy shock from 2013 in France, which eliminated a widely used means of public reporting to banks of the identity of entrepreneurs involved in past corporate liquidations. 

the elimination of this flag increases failed entrepreneurs’ probability of starting a new business by at least 19%. 

Restarters create companies that have a higher probability of default. 

The effect of the reform is significantly more pronounced for younger entrepreneurs, in line with banks rationally using information to update beliefs on entrepreneurs’ ability.



Do activist hedge funds target female CEOs? The role of CEO gender in hedge fund activism

activist hedge funds are about 52% more likely to target firms with female CEOs compared to firms with male CEOs. 

hedge fund activists’ inherent characteristics do not explain the observed gender effect. 

the transformational leadership style of female CEOs is a plausible explanation for this gender effect

female CEOs are more likely to communicate and cooperate with hedge fund activists to achieve intervention goals. 

female-led targets experience greater increases in market and operational performance subsequent to hedge fund targeting.



The cross-section of intraday and overnight returns

cross-sectional variation in stock returns over the trading day and overnight 

Margin requirements are higher overnight, and lending fees are typically charged only on positions held overnight.

Such institutional constraints and overnight risk incentivize arbitrageurs to reduce their positions before the end of the day. 

a mispricing factor earns positive returns throughout the day but performs poorly at the end of the day. 




Testing the Effectiveness of Consumer Financial Disclosure: Experimental Evidence from Savings Accounts


most evidence on consumer financial disclosure’ s effectiveness studies borrowing decisions (where optimality is unclear) or lab experiments (where attention is not scarce). 

We provide field evidence from randomized controlled trials with 124,000 savings account holders at five UK depositories. 

Treated consumers were disclosed varying degrees of salient information about alternative products, including one with their current provider strictly dominating their current product. 

Despite switching taking roughly 15 minutes and the moderate average potential gains ($190/year), switching is rare across disclosure designs and depositors. 

We find pessimistic beliefs drive disclosure inattention and limit disclosure’ s effectiveness, helping explain deposit stickiness.



select article Banks Funding, Leverage, and Investment


Banks’ funding sources have changed significantly during the last two decades. 

The share of non-core funding (NCF) was high before the 2008 crisis but declined substantially after the crisis. 

We propose a general equilibrium model where NCF provides insurance against idiosyncratic risks faced by banks. 

Insurance makes leverage and investment more attractive, but it also increases the vulnerability of the banking sector to crises. 

We show that learning about the likelihood of a crisis could have been important for generating the observed dynamics of NCF and leverage, which in turn affected the dynamics of the macro-economy.



Subjective Cash Flow and Discount Rate Expectations

Why do stock prices vary? 

Using survey forecasts, we find that cash flow growth expectations explain most movements in the S&P 500 price‐dividend and price‐earnings ratios, accounting for at least 93% and 63% of their variation. 

These expectations comove strongly with price ratios, even when price ratios do not predict future cash flow growth. 

In comparison, return expectations have low volatility and small comovement with price ratios. 

Short‐term, rather than long‐term, expectations account for most price ratio variation. 

We propose an asset pricing model with beliefs about earnings growth reversal that accurately replicates these cash flow growth expectations and dynamics.
