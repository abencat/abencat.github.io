Return predictability on firm level is a field that receives less attention compared to aggregrate level. Even though efficient market hypothesis ruled out this possibility, many papers give convincing results that returns are predictable. Many variables are proposed as predictors but this causes some confusions about the prevailing perspective towards to firm-level asset returns. The class models generate very broad implications about the relationship between stock returns and fundamental indicators like dividend price ratios. But this is not enough for stock-level return predictions. The practice shows that stock returns are high volatile and variation cannot be explained by these fundamental indicators. So instead of using firms' financial information, some theories like CAPM or APT predict returns by linking different asset prices using no arbitrage conditions. These theories inspire the conceptual framework of risk loadings. Under this framework, cross variations of stock returns are owning to the difference in risk loading of each stock. However, explanations of cross-sectional variations fail to speak to stock-level return predictability. 

Overall, most doctoral classes on asset pricing speak very little on firm-level stock return predictability. Even from common knowledge, this will be sought after by institutional investors. Searching for factors or alpha is what people in the industry have been found of. But what is the economics behind? Do all of these alpha predictors come out as an occassional finding?
