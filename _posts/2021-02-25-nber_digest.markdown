on the tone of information people choose to consume 

how they incorporate this information into their beliefs. 
 
respondents with more pessimistic prior beliefs about the pandemic are substantially more likely to prefer pessimistic articles (echo chamber)

they also discount information from the article when it is less preferred. 

these motivated beliefs end up impacting incentivized behavior. 

how partisan views interact with information selection and processing. 

source dependence: revealing the news source further distorts information acquisition and processing, eliminating the role of prior beliefs in article choice. 


3.	The Effect of Stock Ownership on Individual Spending and Loyalty


quantify the effects of receiving stocks from certain brands on spending in the brand's stores. 

the staggered distribution of brokerage accounts over time after individuals sign up for a waitlist 

randomly distributed stock grants. 

individuals spend 40% more per week at elected brands and stores after being allocated an account. 

In response to receiving a stock grant, individuals increase their weekly spending by 100% on the granted brands. 

we show that weekly spending in certain brands of our users is strongly correlated with stock holdings of that brand by Robinhood brokerage clients. 

Finally, we present survey evidence to argue that loyalty is the dominant p! sychological mechanism explaining our findings. 

We thus provide micro evidence for the idea that stock ownership drives brand loyalty, which is an intangible asset that leads to lower firm cash flow volatility. 

4.	Housing Consumption and the Cost of Remote Work
Christopher T. Stanton and Pratyush Tiwari #28483 

Abstract:

estimates housing choice differences between households with and without remote workers. 

the expenditure share on housing was more than seven percent higher for remote households 

Remote households’ higher housing expenditures arise from larger dwellings (more rooms) and a higher price per room. 

Pre-COVID, households with remote workers were actually located in areas with above-average housing costs

how much additional pre-tax income would be necessary to compensate non-remote households for extra housing expenses arising from remote work


5.	The Two Faces of Information


public information empowers self-insurance as agents better react to shocks, reducing risk

it weakens market-insurance as common knowledge of shocks restricts trading risk. 

We embody these two faces of information in a single general-equilibrium model.

 We characterize the conditions under which market-insurance is superior, and then public information is socially undesirable. 
 
 In the absence of information, however, market-insurance is still underprovided as individuals fail to internalize its general equilibrium benefits. 

6.	Cross-sectoral Externalities Related to Natural Resources and Ecosystem Services

Standard approaches to environmental and natural resource use externalities generally focus on single-sector resources and user groups.

Remedies include Pigouvian-style government constraints, small group controls following Elinor Ostrom, or less frequently, bargaining across users as outlined by Ronald Coase.

 many difficult natural resource management problems involve competing uses of the same resource or multiple interdependent resources, across multiple, heterogeneous sectors. 
 
 Cross-sectoral externalities are generated and impede attainment of conservation objectives. 
 
 
 The multiplicity of resources and stakeholders, who may have different property rights, hold different use or non-use values, have different traditions, or fall under different regulatory regimes, increases the likelihood of multi-jurisdictional conflicts.

We provide an institutional analysis following Oliver Williamson’s four-levels of institutions (social embeddedness, institutional environment! , governance, resource allocation) to illustrate the sources of potential conflict, the costs of addressing them, and the potentials for exchange. 


In comparing the costs of alternative approaches, we include transaction costs associated with property rights; the costs of lobbying, implementing, and enforcing government regulation; and the costs of scaling up from small-group controls when resource problems involve multiple sectors and heterogeneous populations. 


In our illustrative case examples, instruments that are not formal property rights are exchanged at lower transaction costs. 


We close by discussing how Coasean, Pareto-improving voluntary exchange agreements may be lower cost, more effective, and more durable solutions than alternative management regimes to mitigate cross-sectoral externalities. 



7.	Contractual Rigidity and Political Contestability: Revisiting Public Contract Renegotiations

public procurement in which both contractual flexibility and political tolerance for contractual deviations determine renegotiations. 

contractual flexibility allows for adaptation without formal renegotiation

political tolerance for deviations decreases with political competition. 

renegotiation rates of procurement contracts in which the procurer is either a public administration or a private corporation. 

public-to-private contracts are renegotiated more often than comparable private-to-private contracts

this pattern is more salient in politically contestable jurisdictions. 

The frequent renegotiation of public contracts results from their inherent rigidity

provides a relational quality of adaptability to contingencies in politically contestable environments. 


8.	Urban Growth Shadows

Does a location's growth benefit or suffer from being geographically close to large economic centers? 

Spatial proximity may lead to competition and hurt growth, but it may also improve market access and enhance growth. 

Using data on U.S. counties and metro areas for the period 1840-2017, we document this tradeoff between urban shadows and urban access. 

Proximity to large urban centers was negatively associated with growth between 1840 and 1920, and positively associated with growth after 1920. 

Using a two-city spatial model, we show that the secular evolution of inter-city and intra-city commuting costs can account for this. 

Alternatively, the long-run decline in inter-city shipping costs relative to intra-city commuting costs is also consistent with these observed patterns. 


9.	Culture, Institutions & the Long Divergence


Recent theories of the Long Divergence between Middle Eastern and Western European economies focus on Middle Eastern (over-)reliance on religious legitimacy, use of slave soldiers, and persistence of restrictive proscriptions of religious (Islamic) law. 

These theories take as exogenous the cultural values that complement the prevailing institutions. A

s a result, they miss the role of cultural values in either supporting the persistence of or inducing change in the economic and institutional environment. 

In this paper, we address these issues by modeling the joint evolution of institutions and culture. 

In doing so, we place the various hypotheses of economic divergence into one, unifying framework. 

We highlight the role that cultural transmission plays in reinforcing institutional evolution toward either theocratic or secular states. We extend the model to shed light on political decentralization and technological change in the two regions. 


10.	Competition Policy in a Simple General Equilibrium Model
Louis Kaplow #28482 

Abstract:

The flow of resources across sectors to their best use, with concomitant entry and exit, is central to the functioning and welfare properties of a market economy. Nevertheless, most industrial organization research, including applications to competition policy, undertakes partial equilibrium analysis in a single sector, often with a fixed number of firms. This article examines competition policy in a simple, multi-sector, general equilibrium model with free entry and exit. Even partial equilibrium analysis yields some lessons, such as that accounting for free entry often makes strengthening competition policy more rather than less attractive. When admitting flows between sectors, familiar prescriptions readily reverse. But such results may be partially offset or overturned yet again when incorporating free entry and exit in nontargeted sectors. Finally, the analysis of efficiencies also changes qualitatively with free entry because even fixed costs are fully borne by consume! rs in equilibrium. 

11.	Searching for Job Security and the Consequences of Job Loss
Gregor Jarosch #28481 

Abstract:

Job loss comes with large present value earnings losses which elude workhorse models of unemployment and labor market policy. I propose a parsimonious model of a frictional labor market in which jobs differ in terms of unemployment risk and workers search off- and on-the-job. This gives rise to a job ladder with slippery bottom rungs where unemployment spells beget unemployment spells. I allow for human capital to respond to time spent out of work and estimate the framework on German Social Security data. The model captures the joint response of wages, employment, and unemployment risk to job loss which I measure empirically. The key driver of the “unemployment scar” is the loss in job security and its interaction with the evolution of human capital. 

12.	Vertical Integration and Production Inefficiency in the Presence of a Gross Receipts Tax
Benjamin Hansen, Keaton S. Miller, and Caroline Weber #28478 

Abstract:

We quantify the effects of a gross receipts tax (GRT) on vertical integration for the first time. We use data from the Washington state recreational cannabis industry, which has numerous advantages including a clean natural experiment: a 25% GRT imposed on cannabis firms was subsequently replaced by an excise tax at retail. We find the short-run elasticity of vertical integration with respect to the intermediate good net- of-tax rate is -0.15 and the long-run elasticity is more than twice as large. We find these incentives lead to large output losses – production increases by 23 percent when the GRT is eliminated. 

13.	Aggregate Implications of Barriers to Female Entrepreneurship
Gaurav Chiplunkar and Pinelopi K. Goldberg #28486 

Abstract:

We develop a framework for identifying and quantifying barriers to entry and operation faced by female entrepreneurs in developing countries, and apply it to the Indian economy. We find that despite considerable progress over time, female entrepreneurs still face substantial entry and business registration costs (almost twice their male counterparts’). The costs of expanding a business, conditional on entry, are also substantially higher for women. However, there is one area in which female entrepreneurs have an advantage: hiring female workers is easier for them. We show that this pattern is not driven by the sectoral composition of female employment. Counterfactual simulations indicate that removing all excess barriers faced by women entrepreneurs would: (a) increase the fraction of female-owned firms significantly (nine times); (b) increase the real wages of female relative to male workers; and (c) generate substantial aggregate productivity and welfare gains (ca. 7% an! d 18% respectively). These large gains are due to reallocation: low productivity male-owned firms previously sheltered from female competition are replaced by higher productivity female-owned firms previously excluded from the economy. 

14.	Wage Inequality and Labor Rights Violations
Ioana Marinescu, Yue Qiu, and Aaron Sojourner #28475 

Abstract:

Wage inequality does not fully capture differences in job quality. Jobs also differ along other key dimensions, including the prevalence of labor rights violations. We construct novel measures of labor violation rates using data from federal agencies. Within local industries over time, a 10% increase in the average wage is associated with a 0.15% decrease in the number of violations per employee and a 4% decrease in fines per dollar of pay. Reduced labor market concentration and increased union coverage rate are also associated with reductions in labor violations. Overall, labor violations are regressive: they increase inequality in job quality. 

15.	Preparing for a Pandemic: Accelerating Vaccine Availability
Amrita Ahuja, Susan Athey, Arthur Baker, Eric Budish, Juan Camilo Castillo, Rachel Glennerster, Scott Duke Kominers, Michael Kremer, Jean Nahrae Lee, Canice Prendergast, Christopher M. Snyder, Alex Tabarrok, Brandon Joel Tan, and Witold Więcek #28492 

Abstract:

Vaccinating the world’s population quickly in a pandemic has enormous health and economic benefits. We analyze the problem faced by governments in determining the scale and structure of procurement for vaccines. We analyze alternative approaches to procurement. We find that if the goal is to accelerate the vaccine delivery timetable, buyers should directly fund manufacturing capacity and shoulder most of the risk of failure, while maintaining some direct incentives for speed. We analyzed the optimal portfolio of vaccine investments for countries with different characteristics as well as the implications for international cooperation. Our analysis, considered in light of the experience of 2020, suggests lessons for future pandemics. 

16.	Kinks as Goals: Accelerating Commissions and the Performance of Sales Teams
Peter J. Kuhn and Lizi Yu #28487 

Abstract:

We study the performance of small retail sales teams facing an incentive scheme that includes both a lump sum bonus and multiple accelerators (kinks where the piece rate jumps upward). Consistent with standard labor supply models, we find that the presence of an attainable bonus or kink on a work-day raises mean sales, and that sales are highly bunched at the bonus; inconsistent with those models we find that teams bunch at the kinks instead of avoiding them. Teams’ responses to the kinks are consistent with models in which the kinks are perceived as symbolic rewards, and inconsistent with reference point models where kinks induce loss aversion. 

17.	Does Private Equity Investment in Healthcare Benefit Patients? Evidence from Nursing Homes
Atul Gupta, Sabrina T. Howell, Constantine Yannelis, and Abhinav Gupta #28474 

Abstract:

The past two decades have seen a rapid increase in Private Equity (PE) investment in healthcare, a sector in which intensive government subsidy and market frictions could lead high-powered for-profit incentives to be misaligned with the social goal of affordable, quality care. This paper studies the effects of PE ownership on patient welfare at nursing homes. With administrative patient-level data, we use a within-facility differences-in-differences design to address non-random targeting of facilities. We use an instrumental variables strategy to control for the selection of patients into nursing homes. Our estimates show that PE ownership increases the short-term mortality of Medicare patients by 10%, implying 20,150 lives lost due to PE ownership over our twelve-year sample period. This is accompanied by declines in other measures of patient well-being, such as lower mobility, while taxpayer spending per patient episode increases by 11%. We observe operational changes that! help to explain these effects, including declines in nursing staff and compliance with standards. Finally, we document a systematic shift in operating costs post-acquisition toward non-patient care items such as monitoring fees, interest, and lease payments. 

18.	Fiscal Policy and Households’ Inflation Expectations: Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial
Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Michael Weber #28485 

Abstract:

Rising government debt levels around the world are raising the specter that authorities might seek to inflate away the debt. In theoretical settings where fiscal policy “dominates” monetary policy, higher debt without offsetting changes in primary surpluses should lead households to anticipate this higher inflation. Are household inflation expectations sensitive to fiscal considerations in practice? We field a large randomized control trial on U.S. households to address this question by providing randomly chosen subsets of households with information treatments about the fiscal outlook and then observing how they revise their expectations about future inflation as well as taxes and government spending. We find that information about the current debt or deficit levels has little impact on inflation expectations but that news about future debt leads them to anticipate higher inflation, both in the short run and long run. News about rising debt also induces households to an! ticipate rising spending and a higher rate of interest for government debt.
