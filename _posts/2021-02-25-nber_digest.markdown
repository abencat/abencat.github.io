2.	Biases in Information Selection and Processing: Survey Evidence from the Pandemic


on the tone of information people choose to consume 

how they incorporate this information into their beliefs. 
 
respondents with more pessimistic prior beliefs about the pandemic are substantially more likely to prefer pessimistic articles (echo chamber)

they also discount information from the article when it is less preferred. 

these motivated beliefs end up impacting incentivized behavior. 

how partisan views interact with information selection and processing. 

source dependence: revealing the news source further distorts information acquisition and processing, eliminating the role of prior beliefs in article choice. 


3.	The Effect of Stock Ownership on Individual Spending and Loyalty


quantify the effects of receiving stocks from certain brands on spending in the brand's stores. 

the staggered distribution of brokerage accounts over time after individuals sign up for a waitlist 

randomly distributed stock grants. 

individuals spend 40% more per week at elected brands and stores after being allocated an account. 

In response to receiving a stock grant, individuals increase their weekly spending by 100% on the granted brands. 

we show that weekly spending in certain brands of our users is strongly correlated with stock holdings of that brand by Robinhood brokerage clients. 

Finally, we present survey evidence to argue that loyalty is the dominant p! sychological mechanism explaining our findings. 

We thus provide micro evidence for the idea that stock ownership drives brand loyalty, which is an intangible asset that leads to lower firm cash flow volatility. 

4.	Housing Consumption and the Cost of Remote Work

estimates housing choice differences between households with and without remote workers. 

the expenditure share on housing was more than seven percent higher for remote households 

Remote households’ higher housing expenditures arise from larger dwellings (more rooms) and a higher price per room. 

Pre-COVID, households with remote workers were actually located in areas with above-average housing costs

how much additional pre-tax income would be necessary to compensate non-remote households for extra housing expenses arising from remote work


5.	The Two Faces of Information


public information empowers self-insurance as agents better react to shocks, reducing risk

it weakens market-insurance as common knowledge of shocks restricts trading risk. 

We embody these two faces of information in a single general-equilibrium model.

We characterize the conditions under which market-insurance is superior, and then public information is socially undesirable. 
 
In the absence of information, however, market-insurance is still underprovided as individuals fail to internalize its general equilibrium benefits. 


7.	Contractual Rigidity and Political Contestability: Revisiting Public Contract Renegotiations

public procurement in which both contractual flexibility and political tolerance for contractual deviations determine renegotiations. 

contractual flexibility allows for adaptation without formal renegotiation

political tolerance for deviations decreases with political competition. 

renegotiation rates of procurement contracts in which the procurer is either a public administration or a private corporation. 

public-to-private contracts are renegotiated more often than comparable private-to-private contracts

this pattern is more salient in politically contestable jurisdictions. 

The frequent renegotiation of public contracts results from their inherent rigidity

provides a relational quality of adaptability to contingencies in politically contestable environments. 


8.	Urban Growth Shadows

Does a location's growth benefit or suffer from being geographically close to large economic centers? 

Spatial proximity may lead to competition and hurt growth, but it may also improve market access and enhance growth. 

Using data on U.S. counties and metro areas for the period 1840-2017, we document this tradeoff between urban shadows and urban access. 

Proximity to large urban centers was negatively associated with growth between 1840 and 1920, and positively associated with growth after 1920. 

Using a two-city spatial model, we show that the secular evolution of inter-city and intra-city commuting costs can account for this. 

Alternatively, the long-run decline in inter-city shipping costs relative to intra-city commuting costs is also consistent with these observed patterns. 


9.	Culture, Institutions & the Long Divergence


Recent theories of the Long Divergence between Middle Eastern and Western European economies focus on Middle Eastern (over-)reliance on religious legitimacy, use of slave soldiers, and persistence of restrictive proscriptions of religious (Islamic) law. 

These theories take as exogenous the cultural values that complement the prevailing institutions. A

s a result, they miss the role of cultural values in either supporting the persistence of or inducing change in the economic and institutional environment. 

In this paper, we address these issues by modeling the joint evolution of institutions and culture. 

In doing so, we place the various hypotheses of economic divergence into one, unifying framework. 

We highlight the role that cultural transmission plays in reinforcing institutional evolution toward either theocratic or secular states. We extend the model to shed light on political decentralization and technological change in the two regions. 




15.	Preparing for a Pandemic: Accelerating Vaccine Availability


procurement for vaccines

if the goal is to accelerate the vaccine delivery timetable, buyers should directly fund manufacturing capacity 


16.	Kinks as Goals: Accelerating Commissions and the Performance of Sales Teams

the performance of small retail sales teams

the presence of an attainable bonus or kink on a work-day raises mean sales

sales are highly bunched at the bonus

teams bunch at the kinks instead of avoiding them. 

the kinks are perceived as symbolic rewards, and inconsistent with reference point models where kinks induce loss aversion. 

17.	Does Private Equity Investment in Healthcare Benefit Patients? Evidence from Nursing Homes


the effects of PE ownership on patient welfare at nursing homes. 

a within-facility differences-in-differences design to address non-random targeting of facilities. 

an instrumental variables strategy to control for the selection of patients into nursing homes. 

PE ownership increases the short-term mortality of Medicare patients by 10%、

declines in other measures of patient well-being



18.	Fiscal Policy and Households’ Inflation Expectations: Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial

higher debt lead households to anticipate this higher inflation.

We field a large randomized control trial on U.S. households to address this question

information about the current debt or deficit levels has little impact on inflation expectations


news about future debt leads them to anticipate higher inflation, both in the short run and long run. 

News about rising debt also induces households to anticipate rising spending and a higher rate of interest for government debt.
