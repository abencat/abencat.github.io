P2P lending is a non-collateral lending based on personal credit. The platform gives ratings to the borrowers by credit rating from other institutions like FICO or other info borrowers provided. Some platforms have footprints of users which they can buy from other data companies or own themselves like Amazon or Alibaba. Literature shows that P2P lendings and bank lendings are complements. Fintech captures customers without good credit historys who are limited in access to bank lending (Tang, 2020).

This paper studies the effect of Fintech on wealth inequality. California wildfires provide great empirical setting where the shocks on individual household net worth and therefore people assuming loss in wealth are exposed to poverty trap. They are more like to suffer from foreclosure (Gupta, 2019) and reduce their consumptions in a more aggressive way. However, it is hard to disentangle the effect on inequality.

The question is chopped into different sub-question: (1) does wildfire reduce the house worth? (2) does this reduction expose individual to foreclosure? (3) does Fintech can come in and provide liquidity? The last one is the key.
