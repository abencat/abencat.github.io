Industrial policies have been traditionally debated in each country, even in countries where governmental interventions are not welcomed like US and Britain. In 1970s and 80s, US economy was in a trap of stagnation growth and high unemployment. Most existing policies instruments generated no significant effects. Given the contemporaneous success in emerging countries using industrial policies, they become the topic of debates on the boards.
 
The disagreement, for the most of time, took the dominant positions, not because they were unaware of its potential success or benefits, but most concerns come from the specificity of the political environments in which industrial policies gain success. 

There are many types of industrial policies, such as tax incentives, subsidized credit, direct state involvement, etc. We want to focus on specific industries: national stratigic policies.
