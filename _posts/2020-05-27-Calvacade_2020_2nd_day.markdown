This is the second day of SFS Cavalcade. I am so excited to see Kairong Xiao from Columbia to give presentations. He has two papers , one of which is presented by a doctoral student in Columbia. The one presented by himself is about the effect of capital regulation. It is a very ambitious paper which I cannot imagine. Capital regulation has been the main weapon of bank regulation before the financial crisis. After the Great Depression, liuqidity standards are introduced into the Basel III. Kairong's paper is studying a very broad question: what is the effect of liquidity standard? They look at liquidity mismatch, Federal Home Loan Banks, and financial fragility. They explain this from the perspective of regulatory arbitrage. 

The decline of IPO and public firms has been discussed a lot recently. Theories from regulatory costs, cheaper access to private capital, etc have been proposed to explain this. The average public firm size and size at IPO are all increasing. The winner dominates increasingly more resources. 
â€‹
And also I have seriously listened to one presentation, which is based on computer science from the perspective of economists. Bruno from HEC paris gives a very easy-understanding one discussing why blockchain is developed, which I have never thought about before.

1. Question: How to obtain consensus about distributed ledger among network participants, without central authority? (Internet democracy)

2. Good properties that computer scientists want from blockchains:

	* termination: converge to accept block (people accept block)
	* argeeement: all participants agree on same blocks about their info contained
	* validity: accepted blcok is valid(the distributed ledger contains the correct information)
	
3. Two ways to implement internet democracy:
	* protocol specifies how  to draw randomly which participant will add next block
	* protocol specifies how to vote among committee members
	
Honest processes vs adversaries

processes actually represent machines. Maybe some machines work well while sometimes they don't work. 
fault-tolerant: is consensus reached in spite of f adversaries out of network.

So overall a very happy day!
