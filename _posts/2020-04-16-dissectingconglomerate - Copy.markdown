# A story

Before we really step in what this paper is talking about, we need to have a brief review of three concepts: (1) firms; (2) conglomerates; (3) Tobin's Q. We need to bear in mind three questions related to these concepts: (1) why there exist firms? Why people have to form an organization like firms instead of working separately and use the market to organize everything? (2) why we look at conglomerates? Why conglomerates are special from other non-conglomerates? Are they just huge firms? (3) what is the interpretation of Tobin's Q? why it is related to investment?

To really understand the first question, we need to go back to [Coarse (1937)][coarse:1937], reviewing his classic statement about the nature of firm. There are two important concepts that come from or relate to this question: internal capital market and Tobin's Q. Internal capital market, whose name distinguish itself from external capital market, 

It would be very helpful to catch this paper's idea if we can understand the following concepts and statements. Those concepts will be super important: (1) Tobin's Q; (2) Marginal Q; (3) Internal capital market.  And the statements include: (1) Q-theory of investment; (2) The efficiency of internal capital market. It is very luxurious to talk about three concepts in this short presentation. But it is crucial for us to understand how internal capital market comes into such an important position that we want to use conglomerate as a lab to understand it. Then we will see the big picture of this paper. 



Why we want to look at this problem? We want to estimate divisional tobin'q instead of just standalone tobin's Q because it gives what kind of different insights?


# Comments
This paper develops a new method to estimate the divisional valuation of conglomerates. Assuming that divisions in the same industry by from different conglomerates have the same Q value, the authors use quintile regression to estimate the value of conglomerate divisions. Based on their estimates, the paper found some results different from extant literature. Even though divisional investment is less sensitive to standalone q as shown in the literature, it is more sensitive to divisional q. 

[Lang and Stulz (1994)][lang:1994diver] forms a portfolio of comparable standalone to mimic the performance of conglomerates.

The contribution of this is its novel methodolog. I am personally very fond of the results. However, I need to give it a call to some concepts and model assumptions. Some econometric techniques can help.

My first concern is about the definition of divisional Q. It is kind of ill-defined

My second concern is about the core assumption that all conglomerates have the same divisional Q value.

The third concern is about the interpretation of the estimate. Following the second concern, the identification comes at the cost to assume all the conglomerates have the same divisional q. It is a better to interpret it as an industry Q.
