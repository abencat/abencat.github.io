Mispricing, short-sale constraints, and the cross-section of option returns

insight: market making risks need compensation

demand-based option pricing in imperfect markets, 

short-sale constraints and equity option returns

a monotonic relation between short-sale constraints and  returns of put options on overpriced stocks. 

investors drive up the demand for these put options

dealers command a high premium as compensation for the increased market making risk. 


The Impact of Consumer Credit Access on Self-Employment and Entrepreneurship
Kyle Herkenhoff, Gordon M. Phillips, Ethan Cohen-Cole

insight: individual financial constraints reduce entrepreneurship

self-employment without employees and employer firm ownership increase monotonically with credit limits and credit scores

isolate individuals who have had discrete increases in credit limits after the exogenous removal of bankruptcy flags to measure the effects of personal credit on entrepreneurship. 

Following bankruptcy flag removal, individuals are more likely to start a new employer business and borrow extensively


 Those who own businesses with employees borrow $40,000 more after bankruptcy flag removal, a 33% gain relative to the sample average.



Understanding Momentum and Reversal

insight: 

Bryan T. Kelly, Tobias J. Moskowitz, Seth Pruitt

covariates that predict future returns also predict future realized betas

these characteristics capture time-varying risk compensation. 

We formalize this argument with a conditional factor pricing model. 

instrumented principal components analysis

we estimate latent factors with time-varying factor loadings that depend on observable firm characteristics. 

We show that factor loadings vary significantly over time, even at short horizons over which the momentum phenomenon operates (one year), and this variation captures reliable conditional risk premia missed by other factor models commonly used in the literature. 

Our estimates of conditional risk exposure can explain a sizable fraction of momentum and long-term reversal returns and can be used to generate even stronger return predictions.


Color and credit: Race, regulation, and the quality of financial services
Taylor A. Begley, Amiyatosh Purnanandam

The incidence of misselling, fraud, and poor customer service by retail banks is significantly higher in areas with higher proportions of poor and minority borrowers and in areas where government regulation promotes an increased quantity of lending. Specifically, low-to-moderate-income (LMI) areas targeted by the Community Reinvestment Act have significantly worse outcomes, and this effect is larger for LMI areas with a high-minority population share. The results highlight an unintended adverse consequence of such quantity-focused regulations on the quality of credit to lower-income and minority customers.

Abstract
Abstract
We develop an approach to identify whether recent technological advancements—such as the rise of commercial satellite-based macro estimates—can provide an alternative to government data. We measure the extent to which satellite estimates affect the value of a government macro announcement using its asset price impact. Our identification relies on cloud cover, which prevents satellites from observing economic activity at a few key hubs. Applying our approach, we find that some satellite estimates are now so effective that markets are no longer surprised by government announcements. Our results point to a future in which the resolution of macro uncertainty is smoother and governments have less control over macro information.
