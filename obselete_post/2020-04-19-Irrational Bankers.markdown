This paper provides evidence that behavior factors can be measurably reflected in investors that textbooks treat as professional and sophisticated. These evidences are directed to overoptimism and neglect of crash risk of bank equity investors. (WHO ARE BANKS SHAREHOLDERS?) This paper has no identification and use predictability regressions as the main instruments.

My personal professional views of the role behavior factors are more like an extremist. I think the behavior factors are either minor and ignorable or very fundamental. Even if behavior factors can add to the rational model, they are either temporarily short or just have tiny magnitude. However, if they do cut into the place, they must be a fundamental psychological pattern deeply rooted in mentality. But notwithstanding my views, this paper only provides some evidence but does not directly quantify the economic magnitude of this effect. 

The main results of this paper is three-fold: first

The reason why this problem is interesting in such a setting is that Minsky (1977) and Kindleberger (1978) raise the idea that prolonged periods of economic booms tend to breed optimism. This is plausible because there are already literature showing that experience of crises of different types can affect people's risk aversion. Prolonged periods of economic boom is long enough for optimal investors to burgeon. However, it is hard to find evidence corroborating this idea or at least to disentangle this idea from other channels. Let's take the Great depression (2008-2010) for example. Economists have to come to a census more or less about two points: (1) the source of financial crisis lies in the collapse of mortgage-backed securities and the shock is amplified through the network of CDS. CDS provides an individual insurance while breeds aggregate shocks; (2) Crisis in financial sector leads to a decrease in credit supply, which in turn triggers reduction in employment and investment. However, the reason why the credit expansion happens can be either due to the popularity of CDS and increase in aggregate risks, or due to the risk-shifting behavior due to the regulatory slack. However, in either cases, the investors or bankers are rational and the crisis happens because of a role in regulation. What they are doing is just a result of using information asymmetry  and what happens is just a realization of bad equilibrium. 

If we use behavior factors to explain, the difficulty is: how to define a rational level. Say if you think bankers are overoptimal, what is the rational level of belief? If it is hard to define just like in the research about over-confidence of CEO. Literature about this either uses ex-post results to define or uses cross-sectional relative comparison. 

This paper is written by two very prestigious scholars. However, this question is very challenging and I will definitely not deny that if I do it my paper would be much worse. However, there are still several concerns that might be important for the interpretation.

My first concern is about the first result. The predictability of credit expansion predict an increase in the crash risk of the bank equity index
