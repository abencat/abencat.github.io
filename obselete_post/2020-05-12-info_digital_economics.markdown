In digital economics era, many activities happen online. The key insight here is that when digitalized, what is the difference in people's reaction? When we go to store, we touch, watch, smell, and sometimes try the products by ourselves. Now all of the information is in the same format and we can only read it. Economists are currently interested in people's strategic using digital equipments or products such as social media and online platforms.

Rational people use social media strategically. They will optimalize on the time, the contents, and the format of the information they will convey to the public. And this is part of their human capital. It is an interesting question whether people good at this will also be good at other operational activities. Is there any deeper factor that drives both of them? Jiang et al. (2020) investigate this question by looking at whether there is any correlation between fund initiators' insight of manipulation ability and their later success. 

The experimental setting is in the crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is a scenario where entrepreneurs finance their ideas by selling their ideas to potential investors. These investors are mostly nonprofessional individual investors. When entrepreneurs approach these potential investors, it is important to do good marketing, including designing attractive proposals, polishing the business plans, and sending advertising at the right time and place. This acumen is a scarce ability. This paper
